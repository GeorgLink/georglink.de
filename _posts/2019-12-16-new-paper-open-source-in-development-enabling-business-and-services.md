#### **Abstract:**

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: inherit;">This paper investigates the role of open source participation and employment in the service industry in development. We statistically analyze country-level data from publicly available global databases. The findings suggest that open source participation and employment in the service industry are together and individually positive moderators in the positive correlation of new business formation and development outcomes. This paper contributes to socioeconomic development by identifying ways in which open source participation contributes to development.</span>
